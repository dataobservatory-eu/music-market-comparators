## Contents

**root** - Work in the `qmd` markdown files. If you do not write R code, just ignore the R code chunks, and use it as a clean markdown text. Reproducible `docx`, `pdf`, `epub` versions. `README.md`.

**bib** - please save here individual BibTex entries.  The consolidated entries will should be placed in one of the main `.bib` files in the root folder. The pandoc / knitr / RStudio workflow can have hickups with bib files, so try to save individual files first in `bib/xyz.bib`

**images** - still images used for illustration.

**plots** - data visualizations and charts.
